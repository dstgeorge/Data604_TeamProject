    "As the world attempts to settle into a post-pandemic state of normalcy in 2021, the air travel industry is beginning its recovery. In the United States, smaller regional airports have spearheaded this recovery – with some seeing 12% greater traffic than the same time last year (as of April). Most of this rebound can be attributed to travelers seeking outdoor vacation destinations and those from less risk-averse locations (Bui & Kliff, 2021). A return to pre-pandemic travel behavior by the public is projected to be soon and is only held back by a lagging recovery on the part of business travel. Knowing this, we attempt to revisit domestic U.S. air travel data in order to find patterns which offer insight on pricing, and delays. With the ongoing climate crisis – we also explore questions regarding the viability of more carbon-efficient alternatives to air travel such as high-speed rail. Finally, we inspect the opinions that travelers hold towards their airline and air-travel experience.\n",

    "__Responsible team member: David St. George__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Format:__ This dataset was found on the US Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics website and is in the public domain. The dataset consists of 1 file in csv format, is 61.8 MB, and contains 36 columns. The dataset contains aggregated flight information by month *and* by route and includes: the number of passengers on-board, freight carried (pounds), mail carried (pounds), route distance (in 500 mile categories), the carrier, the origin and destination, month, and the service class for 2019. Of particular interest are the columns identifying the distance flown (either raw distance or categorized), the time period of the flight (month), and the type of cargo. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Cleaning & Loading:__ The dataset was quite clean and did not require much maintenance prior to importing onto the MariaDB server. All of the columns included in the raw dataset have been imported although the majority are not used in the data exploration process. This was done to provide options for merging with the other datasets in the project. The lone cleaning exercise completed was to remove all flights/routes which were not designated as Service Class 'F', meaning Scheduled Passenger/Cargo Service. This filtered out Private or Charter planes, which were not intended as part of the analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Challenges:__ A slight challenge was gaining a complete understanding of each column in the dataset since the keys in a couple of the columns are not intuitive. Some time was spent during the initial exploration stages filtering out desired information in a much more cumbersome way which would have been prevented by reading through all of the key tables before starting. \n",

    "\n",
    "The project investigated 4 separate datasets that all related to seperate topics (average fare, on-time performance, passenger traffic, Twitter US airline sentiment) within the commercial aviation industry. By investigating each of our datasets separately using SQL queries, we were able to draw insightful conclusions on each specific topic within the commercial aviation industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>For the passenger traffic dataset, we found:<u>\n",
    "- 30% of all passengers are travelling on short-haul flights (less than 500 miles)\n",
    "- Charlotte and Atlanta particularly stand out as being areas where short-haul traffic is high\n",
    "- There are clear geographical patterns in popular short-haul routes within the Southeast (GA, FL), Southwest (CA, NV), the state of Hawaii, and Northwest (WA, OR).                                                                                                         \n",
    "<u>For merge #2 (Average fare dataset and passenger traffic dataset), we found:<u>\n",
    "- The top 5 and bottom 5 best value airports by average fare dollar per mile\n",
    "- The best value airport among the top 20 in total traffic (Las Vegas)\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, our project allowed us to gain a thorough understanding of major topics that relate to the pre-pandemic commercial aviation industry. \n",
    "The datasets used in this project are incredibly rich with many other avenues to explore beyond what we have done here.\n"
