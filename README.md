# Data604_TeamProject
Individual contribution for course DATA 604 (Big Data Management) at University of Calgary, Fall 2021

This project was designed to demonstrate the comptencies of loading a large CSV file as a database onto a Apache server and manipulating the database using SQL commands. 

My contribution for the project focused on the T-100 Airline Passenger and Freight Traffic Data from the U.S. Bureau of Transportation. Five guiding questions were
answered using SQL queries as well as a queries using a join with another team member's dataset.
